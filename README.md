##SDES Project-2: Vortex Lattice Method 

The implementation of the method is done using python and the aerodynamic coefficients for flow over a planar wing with given taper ratio and sweep angle is found.

The workflow is divided into 3 stages:-

* Pre-processing
* Solver development
* Post-processing
